 Since the first post, there has been quite a lot of progress on development of the new Web Interface for Retroshare.
As the build process is not using any JavaScript-specific tools, I spent a lot of time making sure that the development process was made as streamlined as possible. All the components are logically isolated and functionality moved to their relevant places.</description>

 The Retroshare communication platform already has a preliminary web interface. But it is severely limited, supports only the basic of interactions with the client, and does not have the nice design and beautiful visual interface that the modern web platform makes possible. This GSoC project will be about creating an entirely new web interface for Retroshare using itâ€™s JSON API to handle all communication between the WebUI and the client.</description>
